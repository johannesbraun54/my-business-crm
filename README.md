“My Business CRM” is a simple, open-source CRM tool designed for small businesses to manage and optimize customer relationships.
The project is based on Angular and offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to store, track and analyze customer information.
It is an easily customizable solution that enables companies to improve their workflows and increase efficiency. This project is related with my other respository:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
